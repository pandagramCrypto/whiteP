            <h2 class="section-title">Introduction: A Meme Coin with a Decentralized Vision</h2>
            <p>Pandagramm is more than just a meme coin. This innovative project aims to redefine the social media experience by integrating a decentralized blockchain (based on Polygon) and allowing its users not only to earn rewards for their engagement but also to actively participate in the governance of the project. Pandagramm seeks to merge meme culture and trending social media movements with the benefits of a sustainable and community-driven digital economy.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Pandagramm’s Mission</h3>
            <p>Our mission is to create a platform where users can interact, create content, and be rewarded for their engagement, while also having real power over the evolution of the project. We aim to build an ecosystem where every action counts and where the community actively shapes the future of Pandagramm.</p>

This interaction will be rewarded with tokens, incentivizing continuous engagement. In addition, Pandagramm's decentralized governance allows users to propose and vote on new features, improvements, and the strategic direction of the platform. The success of Pandagramm hinges on active community participation, and every decision made on the platform will be a result of collective input. By combining the social aspects of networking with a transparent, blockchain-based governance model, Pandagramm empowers its users to shape the platform, making it a true partnership between the project and its community.</p>

        <p>30% of the total PandagrammCoin (PGM) supply, amounting to 300,000,000 PGM tokens, will be dedicated to the ongoing development and expansion of the Pandagramm platform and its ecosystem. This allocation will fund the continuous improvement of the social network itself, ensuring that it remains engaging, secure, and scalable for its growing community. Additionally, these funds will support the development of new applications within the ecosystem, enhancing the platform’s capabilities and offering more value to users. Part of this allocation will also be used to finance partner applications, helping to foster collaboration and integration with other projects that align with Pandagramm’s vision. By investing in the growth of both the social network and partner ecosystem, we aim to create a robust, sustainable platform that can support a wide variety of use cases and ensure long-term success for the entire community.</p>
